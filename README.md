# Symptom-Based-Health-Condition-Classification-and-Clustering

## Project Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to classify and cluster four health conditions—allergy, Flu, Cold, and COVID—based on binary symptom data. The dataset includes imbalanced classes, reflecting real-world healthcare challenges. The goal is to build robust classification models, explore inherent patterns through clustering, and then compare the outcomes for better insight.

## Dataset
The dataset contains binary indicators (0 or 1) for symptoms such as cough, fever, and shortness of breath, representing patients’ symptom profiles. The data is split into training and testing sets.

## Tasks
- **Data Exploration:** Analyze class distribution and dataset characteristics.
- **Classification:** Implement at least two algorithms (Decision Tree, kNN, SVM, etc.) with performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Clustering:** Apply at least two clustering algorithms (K-Means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN, etc.), evaluate clusters using silhouette score or adjusted Rand index, and visualize clusters.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Compare classification and clustering results, discuss insights and limitations.

## Technologies and Tools
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
